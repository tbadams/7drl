# 7drl (Currently "Guess I'll Die" for 2020)
short roguelike game(s) for game jam

Decided on a whim to try making a submission for the 2020 7DRL challenge.  
The intent was a very short coffee-break roguelike with meme overtones in 
which you die a lot.   It turns out python tcod has changed quite a bit since
I last played with it six years ago, and it took most of the time just to set 
up the skeleton of a game. Actual combat mechanics,  more interesting deaths
and an end state  were  all missing in the deadline release, so marking 
incomplete (I mean, they're also missing in later versions too, but I'll
post whatever I add).
